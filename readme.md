This project makes use of the net/http package to download files with a user defined speed limit per second.

The app takes two command line arguments. First argument is the url of the file to be downloaded and the second argument is the speed limit as kb/s. If the second argument is not provided, the default speed limit (100,000 kb/s) is used instead.

Example outputs:
